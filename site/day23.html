      <h2>--- Day 23: Coprocessor Conflagration ---</h2>
      <p>You decide to head directly to the CPU and fix the printer from there. As you get close, you find an <em>experimental coprocessor</em> doing so much work that the local programs are afraid it will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire">halt and catch fire</a>. This would cause serious issues for the rest of the computer, so you head in and see what you can do.</p>
      <p>The code it's running seems to be a variant of the kind you saw recently on that <a href="18">tablet</a>. The general functionality seems <em>very similar</em>, but some of the instructions are different:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>set X Y</code> <em>sets</em> register <code>X</code> to the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
        <li><code>sub X Y</code> <em>decreases</em> register <code>X</code> by the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
        <li><code>mul X Y</code> sets register <code>X</code> to the result of <em>multiplying</em> the value contained in register <code>X</code> by the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
        <li><code>jnz X Y</code> <em>jumps</em> with an offset of the value of <code>Y</code>, but only if the value of <code>X</code> is <em>not zero</em>. (An offset of <code>2</code> skips the next instruction, an offset of <code>-1</code> jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only the instructions listed above are used. The eight registers here, named <code>a</code> through <code>h</code>, all start at <code>0</code>.</p>
      <p>The coprocessor is currently set to some kind of <em>debug mode</em>, which allows for testing, but prevents it from doing any meaningful work.</p>
      <p>If you run the program (your puzzle input), <em>how many times is the <code>mul</code> instruction invoked?</em></p>
    </article>
    <p>Your puzzle answer was <code>6724</code>.</p>
    <article class="day-desc">
      <h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2>
      <p>Now, it's time to fix the problem.</p>
      <p>The <em>debug mode switch</em> is wired directly to register <code>a</code>.  You <span title="From 'magic' to 'more magic'.">flip the switch</span>, which makes <em>register <code>a</code> now start at <code>1</code></em> when the program is executed.</p>
      <p>Immediately, the coprocessor begins to overheat.  Whoever wrote this program obviously didn't choose a very efficient implementation.  You'll need to <em>optimize the program</em> if it has any hope of completing before Santa needs that printer working.</p>
      <p>The coprocessor's ultimate goal is to determine the final value left in register <code>h</code> once the program completes. Technically, if it had that... it wouldn't even need to run the program.</p>
      <p>After setting register <code>a</code> to <code>1</code>, if the program were to run to completion, <em>what value would be left in register <code>h</code>?</em></p>
    </article>
    <p>Your puzzle answer was <code>903</code>.</p>
    <p class="day-success">Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **</p>
    <p>At this point, all that is left is for you to <a href="index.html">admire your Advent calendar</a>.</p>
